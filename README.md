# PowerTeacher-phishing-page
This is a powerschool phishing page I made a few years ago. I've decided to release the code here publicly as a warning about the uses and dangers of phishing attacks. 

I'm hosting a site at powerteachers.c1.biz as a demo of what it looks like and how it functions. DO NOT USE THIS SITE TO ACTUALLY TRY AND STEAL PASSWORDS! Host it yourself if you intend to use it for those purposes. What you host yourself is your buisness, but I kindly ask that you don't use my site for actual phishing attacks. You can host it using biz.nf, ngrok, or other tools for free web hosting. In biz.nf (what I tested this on), it's just a matter of creating a free subdomain and uploading the files and folders in this github project. 

Captured passwords are stored in the log.txt which can be acessed on the demo site here: powerteachers.c1.biz/log.txt. 

In logCREDS.php, you can change the site the page redirects to by changing "Location: https://powerschool.com" to a different site. 

The demo page does not have SSL, so most web browsers will flag the site as insecure. This is to further discourage abuse of the demo site. (I'm also too broke and don't care enough about a demo site to afford a certificate for SSL). Ngrok can be used to port forward to your localhost using SSL, but it only gives temporary, one time use urls.

I decided to release this to raise awareness amongst teachers and schools about phishing. I built this website in 8th grade. Although I myself have never used this site to steal passwords, I let fellow students use a website I was hosting to do just that. It got to the point where over 170 people had used my site to legitmatley steal passwords from teachers (around 30 test logins) before I overheard someone instructing my teacher to make sure they're not logging into powerteacher.c1.biz (no longer exists; took it down after hearing this) and an announcement telling teachers to change their powerschool passwords. The existence of my site got other people into trouble. I was never caught and took down the site as soon as possible. I wrote this little story as a warning for fellow teenagers who might try to use what I have created for similar purposes. I wouldn't use this unless my entire academic career was in jepordy. Even then, it is not worth the risk of getting caught. 

I want this webpage be a lesson to raise awareness of phishing attacks and not a pandemic of skids trying to hack powerschool. I take no responsibility for what you chose to do with this webpage. How you decide to use it is on you. I must simply warn you of the consequences.
